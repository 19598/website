            <p>	Being a cadet at the United States Air Force Academy is my greatest ambition in life. Ever since I discovered the Air Force Academy through an Instagram advertisement, it has been the focus of my life. I have talked to as many graduates as I can contact from various service academies so that they might tell me the secret to receiving an appointment to the greatest college in the world, the United States Air Force Academy. I’ve learned what they loved and what they hated, what they believed helped them get in and what could help me get in. Through all my research, I have come to the conclusion that the Air Force Academy is where leaders are made, and a leader is what I want to be. <br>&emsp;&emsp;The goal of the Air Force Academy is to create leaders. The best example of how the Air Force Academy creates leaders can be seen by watching a documentary on Cadet Basic Training. When you look at the cadets in basic training, they are scared and timid. They aren’t used to being yelled at, and they have no idea what they are doing. But if you look at the Cadre, which are made up of First Class Cadets, you see what these scared cadets will become in just a few years. The Air Force Academy breaks people down so that it can build them back up, and I want to be rebuilt just like those Cadre. <br>&emsp;&emsp;The Air Force Academy provides cadets with a world-class education. I love computers, and hope to receive my degree in computer science. The Air Force Academy would be a fantastic college to receive that degree from, because it is 6th place on Forbes’ list of top STEM schools. The Air Force Academy would help me accomplish my dream of being a computer programmer that I have had since I was in 4th grade, and I would be forever grateful. <br>&emsp;&emsp;The best way to become a pilot in the United States Air Force is through the Academy. A pilot is what I want to be, and I am especially excited about the Academy’s Soaring program, which allows cadets to fly gliders. If I am not eligible to receive a pilot slot, then I will pursue an Air Force career as a Cyberspace Operations Officer and put my degree in computer science to work.<br>&emsp;&emsp;If I am not appointed to the Air Force Academy, not much really changes with my life. I will still get my degree in Computer Science, I will still pursue a career in the greatest Air Force in the world, and I will still do my best to be a leader. But the Air Force Academy has already changed my life by giving me a goal to work for. I studied a great amount for the ACT and received two 33’s and I am in the best physical condition I have ever been in. I used to be underweight, but now I have a healthy Body Mass Index. My ambition to attend the Academy has unfortunately not made me any taller, but mentally and physically I believe it has changed me for the better. I know that every aspect of the Academy is challenging, but I believe that I have what it takes to succeed, and I hope the Academy will give me the chance to try. </p>
