          <h3 class="text-center">The Air Force Academy</h3>
          <p>Going to the Air Force Academy is my dream. The Academy will make me a leader and will give me a great education. I spend an unhealthy amount of time thinking about going to the Academy and doing things to improve my chances of getting in. I watch as many videos and read as many articles as I can. I do pretend interviews while I'm running. I listen to the Academy's radio station, 97.7 KAFA. I also make sure to not lose sight of the end goal, which is to commission as an officer in the U.S. Air Force. This page will be discussing the things I am looking forward to if I get in to the Academy.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Sports</h3>
          <p>Every cadet at the Academy is an athlete. I would really like to get on the golf team, but I'm not sure if I am good enough for college golf. I will try out for the team, but if I don't make the cut then I hope to be on the rifle team, because I enjoy target shooting.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Basic Cadet Training</h3>
          <p>Basic Cadet Training is 6 weeks starting the last week of June. Basic Cadet Training is not fun, but I am still looking forward to it. This is your introduction to military life and it's where you meet lots of people that you will be spending the next four years with. Basic will teach me to be a cadet and how to more effictively work in a team.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Academics</h3>
          <p>Academics at the United States Air Force Academy are extremely challenging. I am looking forward to challenging classes and learning a great deal about Computer Science as well as other important things like physics and calculus.</p>

        <div class="col-md outline">
          <h3 class="text-center">Boxing</h3>
          <p>Boxing is a mandatory class for all Fourth Class Cadets. I have never been in a fight, or any sport that involves sparring. I am looking forward to do boxing because I have never had the opportunity to do anything like that and I think I would like it.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Clubs</h3>
          <p>I would like to participate in a few Academy Clubs. One is Combat Shooting, because I enjoy shooting targets and I think I would be good at Combat Shooting. I would also like to participate in the Cyber Warfare club, as Cyberspace Operations is what I would do if I do not make it as a pilot. I would also like to participate in the Sandhurst team if I can make the cut.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Parachuting and Flying</h3>
          <p>The Academy gives all qualified cadets the opportunity to fly. There is also the opportunity to parachute, which I am looking forward to. I think jumping out of a helicopter or plane would be an amazing experience that is hard to get for free anywhere else.</p>
