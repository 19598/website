          <h3 class="text-center">Why the Military?</h3>
            <p>I want to be an officer in the United States Military because I feel a duty to do so, and I have the ability to do it. Of course, I won't know if I really want to be in the military untill I'm in it, but many things about military life appeal to me. The biggest is uniforms. I have a terrible time figuring out what clothes match, and I usually end up wearing clothes that are dark because I know that they will match. The uniforms are one thing I really enjoy about Four County. Being told what to wear instead of having to pick myself will make my life a lot simpler. I also really enjoy marching when we do it for band, so I think that would also be an aspect of the military that I would enjoy. Ultimately, I think the best thing about being in the military would be the opportunity it gives me to make myself a better leader and a better person. </p>

          <h3 class="text-center">When Was This Decision Made?</h3>
            <p>When I was around 5 years old I decided I wanted to be in the military. I had picked the Marines as my branch, and my mom even took me to see her friend's son who was a Marine at the time. I wanted to be a Marine until about 3rd or 4th grade. At this time, I started to really enjoy computers. I decided I wanted to be a computer programmer at this time, and I tried my best to learn different programming languages. I enjoyed doing things like this, and I still do. But the August before my Junior year, I started to feel like being in the military was what I wanted to do, even if it was only for a little bit. I wanted to be a sniper, becuase I have always enjoyed target shooting, but decided against it because I would have to serve another roll before I could even have the chance to become a sniper. I looked at various other jobs, and eventually decided on a pilot because a degree in Computer Science is common for them. From this point, my plan was to go to college for a degree in computer science and participate in Air Force ROTC. But around the beginning of December 2020, I saw an online advertisement for the United States Air Force Academy. I had seen this advertisement many times before, but I never really gave it a look because for some reason I thought it was for enlisted airmen. But I clicked on the ad and went to their website, and realized that the United States Air Force Academy should be my goal for college. From this point, I started talking to graduates of service academies and studying for the ACT.</p>
