          <h3>Who am I?</h3>
          <p>My Name is Brendan Degryse, and I am a Junior at Four County Career Center. I am hoping to attend the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado. I have completed the precandidate questionaire and am now in the candidate phase.</p>

          <h3>What do I want?</h3>
          <p>I want to be a pilot in the United States Air Force. My goal is to recieve a pilot slot and first class education through the United States Air Force Academy. Getting in to the United States Air Force Academy is extremely challenging, so I am also applying to the United States Military Academy at West Point. I am hoping to attend the West Point Summer Leader Experience. West Point is slightly easier to get into than the United States Air Force Academy, but if I still am not appointed there, I will do Air Force Reserve Officer Training.</p>

          <h3>Timeline</h3>
          <p>I have applied to the West Point Summer Leader Experience, and will recieve notice about whether or not I am accepted to that in early April, 2021. If I am accepted into the West Point Summer Leader Experience, I will attend that for one week at the beginning of June. The United States Air Force Academy Candidate Kit becomes accessible on July 1st, 2021. I will need to complete my Department of Defense Medical Exam Review Board, my Admissions Liason Officer Interview, and Cadet Fitness Assessment at this time. I will also be submitting applications to recieve nominations from Congressman Robert Latta, Senator Robert Portman, Senator Sherrod Brown, and Vice-President Kamala Harris at this time. These nominations must be submitted around January. If I do not recieve one, then I will most likely not be appointed to either academy. If I do, then I will recieve notice on my acceptance or denial between February and April of 2022. If I recieve an appointment, I will go to Cadet Basic Training at the end of June, 2022.</p>
