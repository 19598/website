          <p>My Name is Brendan Degryse, and I am a Junior at Four County Career Center. I am hoping to attend the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado. I have completed the precandidate questionnaire and am now in the candidate phase. I made a game about TACP for my class, you can find it <a href="https://play.unity.com/mg/other/tacp-j69p">here.</a></p>

          <h3 class="text-center">What do I want?</h3>
          <p>I want to be a pilot in the United States Air Force. My goal is to receive a pilot slot and first class education through the United States Air Force Academy. Getting in to the United States Air Force Academy is extremely challenging, so I am also applying to the United States Military Academy at West Point. I am going to attend the West Point Summer Leader Experience. West Point is slightly easier to get into than the United States Air Force Academy, but if I still am not appointed there, I will participate in Air Force Reserve Officer Training. If I do not receive a pilot slot, I hope to serve as a Cyberspace Operations Officer.</p>

          <h3 class="text-center">Timeline</h3>
          <p>I have been accepted to the West Point Summer Leader Experience, and I will attend virtually from 8:00 AM to 2:00 PM every day from June 3rd to June 6th. The United States Air Force Academy Candidate Kit becomes accessible on July 1st, 2021. I will need to complete my Department of Defense Medical Exam Review Board, my Admissions Liaison Officer Interview, and Candidate Fitness Assessment at this time. I will also be submitting applications to receive nominations from Congressman Robert Latta, Senator Robert Portman, Senator Sherrod Brown, and Vice-President Kamala Harris at this time. These nominations must be submitted around January. If I do not receive one, then I will most likely not be appointed to either academy. If I do, then I will receive notice on my acceptance or denial between February and April of 2022. If I receive an appointment, I will go to Basic Cadet Training at the end of June, 2022.</p>
